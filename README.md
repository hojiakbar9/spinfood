## About

Spinfood connects people through shared cooking and dining in a unique and enjoyable way. Based on a lottery draw, two cooking partners are selected to prepare either the appetizer, main course, or dessert. These cooking teams invite their guests into their kitchens and welcome them to a culinary journey, where they move from course to course to new cooking teams.

Diversity is a key component of Spinfood. Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or a meat lover, there's something for every palate. Each cooking team receives a personalized dinner route and all relevant information a few days before the event to ensure a smooth experience.

Whether you sign up as cooking partners together or are matched with suitable participants, Spinfood ensures that you feel connected both culinary and socially. And after all the courses have been enjoyed, the entire Spinfood community gathers at the After-Dinner Party to celebrate the experience and forge new friendships.
